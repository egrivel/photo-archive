# Utilities

The utilities of the _photo archive_ can all be found in the `utils` folder.
This page describes each of the utilities, with use cases on how to use them.

## phbuildhash

## phcheckbackup

Tool to check the integrity of a backup (of the photo files) against a list
of files in the archive with their hashes.

This tool is used with the backup scenario of backing up the individual image
files that make up the photo archive, not when backing up as an actual
on-line archive. With this backup scenario, _all_ the photo files are
backed up, including those marked _private_.

### Prerequisites

 - The photo archive workspace is available
 - The `private/photos.ini` file is configured with at least the `photosdir`
   and `photosdir2` settings providing the directory location(s) of the
   photo files.
 - Note: this tool can operate without the full photo archive environment,
   including databse, having been setup.

### Usage

`phcheckbackup <hashlist>`

### Operation

The tool will read the list of hashes (as generated by the `phlisthash`
tool). For each entry in that list, it will locate the actual file for
that hash in the backup, calculate the fileâ€™s hash, and compare it with the
value from the list of hashes. Mismatches are reported.
